# NeuroLexicon 
Simplified Text Processing Pipeline for Neural Networks

# Project Overview:
NeuroLexicon is designed to streamline the preprocessing of text data for neural network training. This project focuses on essential text cleaning, tokenization, and preparation steps to facilitate the training of neural networks, including simple RNNs and preparation for larger, more complex language models.

# Features:
Text Cleaning and Tokenization: Utilizes basic NLP techniques to prepare text data efficiently.
Simple RNN Example: Demonstrates how to train a simple recurrent neural network on preprocessed text.
Prepared Data Output: Outputs cleaned text data in CSV format, ready for further processing or model training.

# Use Case:
This tool is ideal for students, educators, and developers starting out in NLP or those needing a straightforward script to preprocess text for neural network training.

# Getting Started:
Clone the repository: Get the code by cloning this repo to your local machine or downloading it as a ZIP file.
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the following packages installed:
Python 3.6+
pandas for data manipulation
nltk for natural language processing tasks
torch for neural network construction and training
torchtext for additional text processing tools specific to PyTorch

You can install these with the following pip commands:

pip install pandas nltk torch torchtext

Prepare Your Data: Place your text data in the txt directory specified in the script.
Run the Script: Execute the script via the command line to process your data and train the RNN.
Check the Output: Look in the specified output directory for the CSV files containing your processed data.
